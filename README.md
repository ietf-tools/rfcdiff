# rfcdiff

[rfcdiff web service](https://author-tools.ietf.org/iddiff) | [rfcdiff script](https://github.com/ietf-tools/rfcdiff/raw/main/rfcdiff)

The purpose of this program is to compare two versions of an
internet-draft, and as output produce a diff in one of several
formats:
 * side-by-side html diff
 * paged wdiff output in a text terminal
 * a text file with changebars in the left margin
 * a simple unified diff output

In all cases, internet-draft headers and footers are stripped before generating the diff, to produce a cleaner diff.
